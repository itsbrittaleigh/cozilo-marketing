            Cozilo is a truly business-only, mobile marketplace for business owners who want to
            buy, sell, or trade new or used goods without having to sort through the clutter of
            consumer goods like in other selling apps. As an added layer of security, only
            approved businesses become part of the Cozilo ecosystem.

            <p class="color-white">
              Cozilo was built to be a true B2B marketplace where approved businesses
              could buy, sell, trade, and interact specifically with other business owners
              in their area. Without the clutter of consumer goods in our app, finding the
              products your company needs - office furniture, heavy-duty machinery, POS
              computers - has never been easier.
            </p>
            <p class="color-white">
              From the clean, organized sales feed to the simple post creation process,
              Cozilo’s user-friendly interface means you can be out of the office, yet still
              totally in control of your business and it’s sales flow.

            <p class="color-white">
              Instead of having to barter over cash value for products, Cozilo Tokens supply
              a means of gaining ‘future value’ for items you don’t want or need today. Accept
              Cozilo Tokens for your items today, typically at a discount to get it off your
              hands sooner, and you can bank tokens for future use of something you may want.
            </p>
            <p class="color-white">
              For signing up, users receive 500 Cozilo tokens to start using immediately.
              You can also earn more by selling your items for split or wholly for tokens.

              happen between real, actual businesses and their owners - you’ll never have to
              worry about transactions falling through or users not being who they say they are.

              Cozilo uses multi-level, transport layer security with the latest security protocols,

              Unlike other marketplaces that only feature brand new, expensive goods,
              you can search through new or gently-used items in the Cozilo marketplace.
              This is a much more cost-efficient way for your business to find the products
              you need.

            </h2>
            <p class="hidden">
              By requiring account verification, we can ensure that only legitimate businesses
              are a part of the Cozilo community. Additionally, a multi-faceted rating system
              is in place for users to rate their interactions and transactions with others,
              allowing them to know who they’re buying or selling with before even contacting
              them.

            <h2 class="color-orange hidden">Choose your method of payment</h2>

              Payment options include Cozilo tokens, all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard,
              Discover, and American Express), smart wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as
              well as ACH. Additionally, if your account has multiple payment methods, you can
              combine the various forms of payment to complete your transaction.
