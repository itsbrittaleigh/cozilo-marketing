              Cozilo was built to be a true B2B marketplace where approved businesses
              could buy, sell, trade, and interact specifically with other business
              owners in their area. Without the clutter of consumer goods in our app,
              finding the products your company needs&mdash;office furniture, heavy-duty
              machinery, POS computers&mdash;has never been easier.

              From the clean, organized sales feed to the simple post creation process,

              still totally in control of your business and its sales flow.

            <p class="hidden">
              Instead of having to barter over cash value for products, Cozilo Tokens
              supply a means of gaining "future value" for items you don't want or
              need today. Accept Cozilo Tokens for your items today, typically at a
              discount to get it off your hands sooner, and you can bank tokens for
              future use of something you may want.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
              For signing up, users receive 500 Cozilo Tokens to start using immediately.
              You can also earn more by selling your items for split or wholly for tokens.

              Unlike other marketplaces that only feature brand new, expensive goods,
              you can search through new or gently-used items in the Cozilo marketplace.
              This is a much more cost-efficient way for your business to find the products

              By requiring account verification, we can ensure that only legitimate businesses
              are a part of the Cozilo community. Additionally, a multi-faceted rating system
              is in place for users to rate their interactions and transactions with others,
              allowing them to know who they’re buying or selling with before even contacting
              them.

              well as ACH. Additionally, if your account has multiple payment methods, you can
              combine the various forms of payment to complete your transaction.
